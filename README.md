## Week1 Karatsuba's Multiplication Algorithm (using Gauss' trick)

Crude implementation from learning Algorithms and trying to implement them in Elixir. There will be better ways everywhere!

## Week2 - Counting Inversions

Could not figure out a beautiful functional way of iterating over multiple arrays in Elixir while doing index operations so dropped down to Go where I have very fine grained control.
